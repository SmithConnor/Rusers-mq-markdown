```{r load_data, echo=FALSE}

# Fill the following information in
# options: Bilbo, Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Saruman, Lurtz
fav_char <- "Lurtz"
```

In the Lord of the Rings, my favourite charater is `r fav_char`. We can check how many words `r fav_char` spoke during the movie with the following code:

```{r words_spoken}
lotr_fav <- lotr %>%
  filter(Character == fav_char) %>%
  summarise(Total_Words = sum(Words))
```

I'm not sure this is correct but it seems that `r fav_char` only spoke `r lotr_fav` words in the entire movie.
