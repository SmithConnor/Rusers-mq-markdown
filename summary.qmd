# Summary

The basic gist of RMarkdown is as follows:

1.  Create a text file and save it as a `.Rmd`
2.  Fill it with plain text and code
3.  Compile

## Markdown Syntax

You can use the visual editor for a lot of this but the basic syntax is outlined below:

| Style       | Format               |
|-------------|----------------------|
| *Italic*    | \*text\* or \_text\_ |
| **Bold**    | \*\*text\*\*         |
| Inline Code | \`text\`             |
| Hyperlinks  | \[text\]\(link\)         |
| Subscript   | \~text\~               |
| Superscript | \^text\^               |

For different sections use headers:

```{r}
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4
```

and if you do not want them numbered just add `{.unnumbered}` afterwards.

## Exercise

Add a hyperlink to `lotr.rmd` that links to this document. Also make sure that the link text is **bold**
