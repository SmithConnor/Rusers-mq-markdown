## Tables

### Text

| Shape   | Sides | Other             |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| Circle  | 1     | Comfortable ring. |
| Triange | 3     | Umm.....          |
| Square  | 4     | Yeah nah          |

: Not the round table!

```{r}
#| eval: false

| Shape   | Sides | Other             |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| Circle  | 1     | Comfortable ring. |
| Triange | 3     | Umm.....          |
| Square  | 4     | Yeah nah          |
```

### Code

```{r}
library(kableExtra)

# create fake data
df <- data.frame(
  names = c("Donald Duck", "Mickey Mouse", "Goofy"),
  salaries = c(100000, 150000, 50000)
)

# create the table
kable(df, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")


```

## Figures

### Generated

Reproducible figures can be generated in the RMarkdown document in a code chunk.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# create fake data
df <- data.frame(
  category = c("Cats", "Dogs", "Birds"),
  count = c(15, 27, 10)
)

# create the plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = category, y = count, fill = category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Animals that stole my heart",
       subtitle = "But not my socks",
       x = "Animal",
       y = "Number of times stolen") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        legend.position = "none")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

```

### Chunk options

Below is a curated list of chunk options for figures. As you learn more, this list might vary for you.

| Option       | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `fig.height` | Height of the figure in inches. (Coded as 9 not "9")                        |
| `fig.width`  | Width of the figure in inches. (Coded as 9 not "9")                         |
| `fig.align`  | Where do you want your figure i.e. `default`, `centre`, `left`, or `right`? |
| `fig.cap`    | Add a caption to your figure.                                               |

: Chunk Options for Figures

Each of these options can be defined in each chunk of you can define them globally *(best included in your first code chunk)*:

```{r}
#| eval: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(chunk_option1 = TRUE, chunk_option2 = FALSE, ...)
```

::: callout-important
Best practice is to save all your figures. This can be done by inserting the following code into your YAML header:

```{yaml}
output:
  html_document:
    keep_md: true
```

**Note:** This code will be different if you are using a different output format.

### Exercise

Change the figure in `lotr.Rmd` to have:

-   a height of 5 inches, and
-   a width of 3 inches.

Make sure to save the image as well. Can you locate the saved image in your files?
